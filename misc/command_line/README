=======================================
ACE Command Line Prototype, version 2.1
=======================================

January 11, 2008

Chris,

This version of the command line prototype responds to the following feedback
that you provided:

> 1) Allow calibration datasets to be dated in the dating workflow.

Fixed. I simply copied the directories in data/calibration-sets to data/sets.

> 2) Don't allow a calibration dataset from one nuclide to be used to
>    calibrate a different nuclide

Fixed. I also made similar fixes in a number of places where the command
line prototype was showing invalid selections in its user interface. As an
example, now when you run the "Apply Experiment" command, the sample sets
listed as choices are only those samples sets that can be processed by
the selected experiment (as determined by the experiment's nuclide.)

I, unfortunately, did not address this request:

> 3) When choosing not to save a calibration, allow the user to tweak
> an original value and try again.

This would have required some major tweaking of the structure of the command
line prototype and I'd rather spend that time working on the GUI version of
ACE. But, yes, in the GUI prototype I plan to merge the "Create Experiement",
"Calibrate Experiment", and "Strip Calibration From Experiment" functions
into a single UI. If you want to tweak an experiment after a calibration,
you'll be able to strip the calibration, tweak a value, and calibrate again.

Finally, I added a new program called "import_sample_set.py".

Invoke it like this:

"python import_sample_set.py name_of_csv_file.csv"

It will load the csv file and attempt to create a new sample set. If it
succeeds, it will ask you to name the new set and then save it such that
the ACE command line prototype can process it.

I have included the file 21Ne.csv to give you an example CSV file to test this
new feature. It is simply the "21Ne_CerlingGeology1994" sample set in CSV form.

This should be the LAST version of the ACE command line prototype... all future
development will focus on the GUI version of ACE.

P.S. The first time you run ACE.py, it may take a long time to start up. It
should start up faster on subsequent runs.

P.P.S. It should be possible to perform batch experiements with this version
of the command line prototype with the invocation

python ACE.py < infile

You will need to do some "advanced exploration" so you know what numbers need
to be entered into "infile" but for instance to apply experiement "1" to
sample sets 1-7, you can probably do something like:

10
1
1
10
1
2
10
1
3
10

4
10
